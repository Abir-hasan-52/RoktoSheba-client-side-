            About Roktosheba
          </h2>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Roktosheba is a voluntary blood donation platform dedicated to
            saving lives by connecting donors with patients in need. Our mission
            is to build a bridge between humanity and hope â€” ensuring that no
            life is lost due to unavailability of blood.
          </p>
          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
            Through Roktosheba, anyone can register as a donor, request blood in
            emergencies, and find matching donors quickly and securely. We
            believe that a single drop of blood can give someone a new chance at
            life.
